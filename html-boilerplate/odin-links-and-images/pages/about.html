<h1>This is the about page in links</h1>
<p>it sits in /pages </p>  
<p>Think of your domain name (<code>town.com</code>) as a town, <br>
    the directory in which your website is located (<code>/museum</code>) as a museum, 
    and each page on your website as a room in the museum (<code>/museum/movie_room.html</code> <br>
    and <code>/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html</code>). <br>
    Relative links like <code>./shops/coffee_shop.html</code> are directions from the current room (the museum movie room <code>/museum/movie_room.html</code>) to another room (the museum shop). 
    <br>   
    Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (<code>https</code>), <br>
    domain name (<code>town.com</code>) and the path from that domain name (<code>/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html</code>): <code>https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html</code>.</p> 
<p>An image doesnÂ´t need a closing element just the img tag <br>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png"
    alt="odin project logo"> </p>

<p>Relative links for images are also possible eg /images/poodle.jpg  <br>
<img src="../images/poodle.jpg" 
alt= "black poodle">
