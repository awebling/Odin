hereś a new test
Edison was open to failure
Who knows how many songs lennon and mccartney had before they created success
YOu can´t wait around for divine inspiration
You have to force it
creativity is 99% perspiration , 1 % inspiration

¨David Bowie, A life"  by Dylan Jones

## Shane Snow - creativity needs to be fluid. The longer people work together, the longer they start working the same way
__ Creativity requires friction __
# Benefit of a Devilś Advocate - creates friction, forces you to justify the idea
Two people thinking over an idea from different perspectives
Suspend reflex to ignore them

## Steven Johnson "Where Good Ideas Come From¨
    The Phoenix Memo - the Hunch about 9/11
        Great ideas often come half-baked - A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something

## Kevin Ashton - Creativity   
_"How To Fly A Horse: The Secret History of Creation, Invention, and Discovery" (Doubleday 2015)_
We build on those who have come before us
The more of us there are the more we create - as population increases, so does creativity
